 Functional overview
 - Streak represents streak-related metrics calculated from StudySession as the single source of truth.
 - The current streak is computed from calendar days derived from StudySession.normalizedDay.
 - Missing days (no sessions recorded) are treated as failures and break the streak.
 - The anchor day is flexible: if today is already met, we anchor at today; otherwise, we anchor at yesterday (the last fully completed day) and count backwards.
 - The rule for a day being "met" is currently: at least one topic's goal was met for that day (see isDayMet).
 - We do not persist explicit "failure" records (e.g., days without sessions or unmet goals). Instead, streak values are computed dynamically from existing StudySession records whenever needed.

 Technical notes
 - Day normalization is delegated to StudySession.normalizedDay to avoid duplicate normalization logic and timezone drift.
 - DailyStatus.compute(from:) aggregates sessions per topic within a day and exposes `isMet` per topic; we derive a single boolean per day via isDayMet.
 - The computation builds a [Date: Bool] map (metByDay) using normalized days and iterates backward from the chosen anchor, stopping on gaps or unmet days.
